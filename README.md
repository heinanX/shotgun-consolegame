**Shotgun — Instructions**

Description
Shotgun is a simple console game where you play against the computer. You can choose between three actions: Shoot, Load, and Block. The goal is to defeat the computer by shooting when your opponent isn’t blocking or shooting — or by using Shotgun once you’ve collected 3 bullets (or an even more mind blowing secret weapon!).

`Rules:`

Both players start with 0 bullets.

Load gives you +1 bullet.

Shoot uses 1 bullet. If both players shoot, they each lose 1 bullet, and no one wins.

Block protects you from being shot.

When you have 3 bullets, you can use Shotgun — this wins automatically unless the opponent shoots their shotgun at the same time.
