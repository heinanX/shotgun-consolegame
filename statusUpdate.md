Add comparison for moves

Add SpaceRock logic (change name?)

Add stats for won vs lost games. (Inside ReadGameData)

x offer shotgun maybe an accept or decline option. if decline prompt new move

save old game stats to .txt file

Future Ideas:
x Add a ReadRules method that explains the game inside GameLogics.
static public void ReadRules()
{

}
